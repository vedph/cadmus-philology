# Cadmus.Philology.Parts

This solution contains the Cadmus philologic parts library derived from `Cadmus.Philology.Parts` in the core Cadmus solution, in the context of the general refactoring towards a more streamlined and modular system. The library includes all the old parts with no additions or modifications. No part or fragment ID has been changed.

## History

### 6.0.1

- 2023-02-02: migrated to new components factory. This is a breaking change for backend components, please see [this page](https://myrmex.github.io/overview/cadmus/dev/history/#2023-02-01---backend-infrastructure-upgrade). Anyway, in the end you just have to update your libraries and a single namespace reference. Benefits include:
  - more streamlined component instantiation.
  - more functionality in components factory, including DI.
  - dropped third party dependencies.
  - adopted standard MS technologies for DI.
