# Cadmus.Philology.Parts

This solution contains the Cadmus philologic parts library derived from `Cadmus.Philology.Parts` in the core Cadmus solution, in the context of the general refactoring towards a more streamlined and modular system. The library includes all the old parts with no additions or modifications. No part or fragment ID has been changed.
