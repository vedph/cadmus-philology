/// depends on the diffing library used.</typeparam>
/// <remarks>Implementors of this interface are used to pre-populate the
/// misspelling operations given a start and an end form. In most cases,
/// the result will be ok; in some cases, when the user wants to convey
/// a specific linguistic meaning with the misspelling operations, the
/// result will require to be manually edited. In both cases, this speeds
/// up the data entry process, as users just have to select a word form,
/// enter its standard-orthography counterpart, and get the corresponding
/// misspelling operations. For instance, the user might select the word
/// <c>bixit</c> from an epigraphical Latin text, and type the
/// orthographically correct form <c>vixit</c>; a differ would then detect
/// the differences between these two forms, and produce a single misspelling
/// operation: <c>"b"@1×1="v"</c>, i.e. "replace the initial b- with v-".
